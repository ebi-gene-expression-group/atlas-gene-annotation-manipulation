# Gene annotation manipulation

This package currently holds one script: gtf2featureAnnotation.R (though it may contain more in future). gtf2featureAnnotation.R takes a GTF annotation file and creates a table of annotation by feature, optionally filtering a cDNA file supplied at the same time. For full usage instructions run:

```
gtf2featureAnnotation.R --help
```
